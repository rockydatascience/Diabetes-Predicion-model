# Diabetes Risk Detector

## Abstract
Diabetes is a prevalent chronic disease globally, affecting millions of people. Early detection of diabetes risk factors such as age, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level can lead to timely interventions and improved health outcomes. This project aims to develop machine learning models to predict the risk of diabetes based on these key health indicators.

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to build predictive models that assess the risk of developing diabetes using demographic information and health metrics. By analyzing factors such as age, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level, we aim to identify individuals at higher risk of diabetes for proactive medical management and lifestyle interventions.

## Project Description
In this project, we will work with a dataset containing demographic information and health metrics of individuals. The dataset includes features such as age, hypertension status, heart disease status, BMI, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. The target variable indicates whether each individual has been diagnosed with diabetes.

## Desired Problem Outcome (Objective or Goal)
The primary goal is to develop accurate and reliable machine learning models that predict the likelihood of diabetes based on demographic and health-related attributes. These models will assist healthcare providers in identifying individuals at risk of developing diabetes early, enabling timely interventions to prevent or manage the disease effectively.

## Algorithms
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Decision Tree

## About the Data
The dataset includes the following features:

### Demographic Information
- **Age:** Age of the individual.

### Health Metrics
- **Hypertension:** Whether the individual has hypertension (Yes/No).
- **Heart Disease:** Whether the individual has heart disease (Yes/No).
- **BMI:** Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight.
- **HbA1c Level:** HbA1c level, a measure of average blood glucose levels over the past three months.
- **Blood Glucose Level:** Fasting blood glucose level.

### Target Variable
- **Diabetes Diagnosis:** Whether the individual has been diagnosed with diabetes (Yes/No).

## Instructions for Use
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values and outliers appropriately.
   - Normalize or scale numerical features if required.
   - Encode categorical variables (if any).

2. **Model Training:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train each machine learning algorithm (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Tree) on the training data.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate each model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Select the best-performing model based on evaluation results.

4. **Prediction:**
   - Use the trained models to predict the risk of diabetes for new individuals based on their demographic and health metrics.

5. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the trained models in a production environment if needed for real-time risk assessment.

## Example Code Snippet

```python
# Example code for model training and evaluation
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from xgboost import XGBClassifier
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Assuming 'X' contains features and 'y' contains the target variable 'Diabetes Diagnosis'
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train models
models = {
    'Logistic Regression': LogisticRegression(),
    'Random Forest': RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42),
    'XGBoost': XGBClassifier(random_state=42),
    'Decision Tree': DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)
}

for name, model in models.items():
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f"{name} Accuracy: {accuracy}")
